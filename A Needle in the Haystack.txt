Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:

Example(Input --> Output)

["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] --> "found the needle at position 5" 

Note: In COBOL, it should return "found the needle at position 6"

SOLUTION



public class Kata {
  public static String findNeedle(Object[] haystack) {
    // Your code here
    for(int i = 0; i < haystack.length; i++){
      if("needle".equals(haystack[i])){
        return String.format("found the needle at position %s", i);
      }else{
        continue;
      }
    }return null;
  }
}
